# Basic Todo List

A short-term todo list application with four simple features: 1) adding an item, 2) checking off an item, 3) removing an item, and 4) archiving an item for later. 

(Todo List contains a few items by default, just for display purposes.)


###### Adding An Item
To add a new item, just click on the input bar under the TODO LIST header where it says "Add a new item." Type in an item and press enter to add to the list. This input bar can also be hidden for a simpler display by pressing on the plus sign on the drop right corner.

###### Checking Off An Item
To indicate that an item has been completed, click on the item and a strikethrough will appear over the item. (This is not to be confused with deleting the item.)

###### Removing An Item Permanently
To completely remove the item from the list, hover over the item so that a red trash icon appears on the left of the item. Click on said icon to permanently delete the item.

###### Archiving An Item For Later
To archive an item for later, drag and drop the item over the file cabinet icon on the top right corner. The item will temporarily be hidden. When ready to take on archived items, click on the file cabinet icon once again and all archived items will reappear.
